  <h1>Hi, I am <span>Olaya.</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">
  I’m Olaya Álvarez-Tuñón, a Postdoctoral Researcher with a passion for Robotics, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. 
  I completed my Ph.D. in Robotics and Computer Vision at Aarhus University,
  and I’m currently working at EIVA A/S while collaborating with the Software Quality Research (SQUARE) 
  group at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU).

  My research focuses on Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM),
  Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.
  I’m particularly interested in applying artificial intelligence to improve visual SLAM algorithms for underwater robotics.

  On my free time, I enjoy (too) many things, such as painting, reading, hiking… or anything that gets
  me far from the PC for a bit.</span></p>
