  <h1>Hi, I am <span>Olaya.</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">
  I’ve been a researcher since I got my graduate as an Electronics Engineer in 2015.
  In 2020 I’m starting my PhD studies in the field of Robotics, Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
  I also have a bunch of personal projects that I will publish here, so feel free to sneak on my blog!

  On my free time, I enjoy (too) many things, such as painting, reading, hiking… or anything that gets
  me far from the PC for a bit.</span></p>
